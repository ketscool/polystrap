PolyStrap
=========

Google Material design paper element effects using  HTML/CSS/JS

LATEST VERSION v3.0.1.1
------------

This is first version of polystrap.

What? Why?
------------
+	**What**: Polystrap is my idea to create HTML responsive front end using bootstrap but with effects similar to Google Material design paper elements.
+	**Why**: Developing web components using ruby npm bower etc etc is for geeks and real nerds.
But what about pseudo nerds ? They too are geeks but they also want to spend time with booze and broad?
My these efforts are for such pseudo nerds.
Easy to use/integrate responsive HTML template with look & feel like Google material design paper elements

Technologies

**Twitter Bootstrap** - for easy customization and responsive design

**LESS CSS** - Personal preference over SASS

**JQuery/Javascript** - For element effects like Google material design paper elements
